# SystemsProgramming

In this project, utilizing the Libfdr library, an input file entered via the terminal is parsed to read commands such as "yaz" (write), "sil" (delete), "sonagit" (output last), and "dur" (terminate). Based on the command provided via the terminal, a corresponding output file is generated in the code. The commands dictate actions to be performed, and their results are written to this output file.
